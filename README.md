# music-shuffler

#### This is the slow-running and unoptimized code for the Electron app that would randomly take audio files in a list of specified folder (and specified subfolders).
#### The user could specify how many songs to take from each folder in the song library (the song library would be pre-organized manually) and the app would copy a randomized set of files to another specified folder.
#### Once a song has been selected within a set, that file is marked so that the program will not select it the next time a shuffled set is made
#### The client has to click the reset button that clears any markings on the files so that once again any of the songs may be chosen
#### The above features are all requests made by the client, who never responded nor paid me for my–admitably mediocre–services.
